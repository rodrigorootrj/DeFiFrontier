New Business Model for Artists: Tokens That Generate Tokens and Unlock Exclusive Experiences

Imagine a system where singers and bands can launch their own tokens, and fans who hold them can earn rewards just by holding.

Here’s how it works:

1. An artist launches their official token.

   * Example: *Bionce creates “DefiBionceCoin”*.

2. Fans who hold (stake) this token automatically generate a **second token**, similar to yield farming or proof of stake.

   * In Bionce’s case, holding DefiBionceCoin generates **LiquidDefiBionceCoin (LDBCoin)**.

3. This second token (LDBCoin) is the “access key” for exclusive fan experiences, such as:

   * Raffles for signed or limited-edition merch.
   * Discounts on VIP/cabana tickets.
   * Access to meet & greets, pre-sales, or special events.

**Example in action:**
Bionce announces a show in Florida. For this event, she opens a raffle for 100 limited-edition signed T-shirts.

* Each raffle ticket can only be purchased with **LDBCoin**.
* This means only real token holders have access to participate.

On top of that, a **secondary market** for LDBCoin would naturally emerge. Fans who want to join the raffle but don’t hold enough can buy LDBCoins from others, creating liquidity and an entire micro-economy around fandom.

**Why it matters:**

* Artists build stronger, more engaged communities.
* Fans get rewarded for their loyalty and long-term support.
* A new fan-driven economy is born at the intersection of blockchain + entertainment.

Do you want me to shape this more like a **pitch (eye-catching, persuasive)** or more like a **discussion post (neutral, asking for feedback)** for Reddit?
